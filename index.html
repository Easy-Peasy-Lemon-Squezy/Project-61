        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Hello! Nice to meet u. My favourite movie is 'Harry Potter'. This movie have total 8 parts in 2020. And all of those parts are gud but.. the 2nd part is My favourite 'Harry Potter And The Chambers Of Secret' it's name is very nice. And the movie is also nice! It's all about a type of 'Mystery' and I like mysteries. in all parts of this movie, everyone have used 'magic'. it's all about magic and that's why I like this movie. So let me tell you about the characters. 1st - Harry Potter. He is the main character in all 8 parts. You can see him in picture above. He is standing better. 2nd - Hermione Granger. She is friend of Harry Potter. She is very Intelligent. You can see her standing in picture above. In picture, There's only 1 girl so you can know who is Her. 3rd - Ron Weasly. He is very funny. He is also friend of Harry Potter. You can see him in picture above. Only 1 left because you now know who is Harry and Hermione, one is left. So now you know who is ron, hermione and harry. In the picture, you can see a stick in their hands. they are actually 'wands' or you can say 'jadui chadhi'. In all parts of this movie, they have only 1 target 'defeat Lord Voldemort'. Voldemort was the killer of harry potter's parents. he wants to take revenge from Voldemort. in first 4 parts, he fights alone with many problems like a very big snake who lives in 'mysterious chamber' in part 2 of this series 'Harry Potter And The Chamber of secret'. but after it, when everyone knows that Voldemort is still alive, they start fighting with harry. I will try to make a webpage in which I will explain all parts of harry potter series. 25/1/2021 It's difficult I'm still trying. </p>
